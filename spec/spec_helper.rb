#Linstor REST API

#Linstor REST API V1  The V1 rest api of Linstor should stay compatible and only additions are made to the API, If there are breaking changes or redesigned a new major REST API version will be issued.  Server runs per default on port `3370` on `::` ipv6 and ipv4.  To change the bind address or port you can use the following linstor client commands: ``` linstor controller set-property REST/bindAddress 127.0.0.1 linstor controller set-property REST/port 8080 ```  After setting this properties restart the controller and the new values should be used.

# load the gem
require 'ruby-linstor-client'

# The following  was generated by the `rspec --init` command. Conventionally, all
# specs live under a `spec` directory, which RSpec adds to the `$LOAD_PATH`.
# The generated `.rspec` file contains `--require spec_helper` which will cause
# this file to always be loaded, without a need to explicitly require it in any
# files.
#
# Given that it is always loaded, you are encouraged to keep this file as
# light-weight as possible. Requiring heavyweight dependencies from this file
# will add to the boot time of your test suite on EVERY test run, even for an
# individual file that may not need all of that loaded. Instead, consider making
# a separate helper file that requires the additional dependencies and performs
# the additional setup, and require it from the spec files that actually need
# it.
#
# The `.rspec` file also contains a few flags that are not defaults but that
# users commonly want.
#
# See http://rubydoc.info/gems/rspec-core/RSpec/Core/Configuration

    # This option will default to `true` in RSpec 4. It makes the `description`
    # and `failure_message` of custom matchers include text for helper methods
    # defined using `chain`, e.g.:
    #     be_bigger_than(2).and_smaller_than(4).description
    #     # => "be bigger than 2 and smaller than 4"
    # ...rather than:
    #     # => "be bigger than 2"
