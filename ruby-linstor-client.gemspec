#Linstor REST API

#Linstor REST API V1  The V1 rest api of Linstor should stay compatible and only additions are made to the API, If there are breaking changes or redesigned a new major REST API version will be issued.  Server runs per default on port `3370` on `::` ipv6 and ipv4.  To change the bind address or port you can use the following linstor client commands: ``` linstor controller set-property REST/bindAddress 127.0.0.1 linstor controller set-property REST/port 8080 ```  After setting this properties restart the controller and the new values should be used.
